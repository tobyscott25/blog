I recently installed Ubuntu Linux on a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro, although I had to connect an external keyboard to go through the installation process because the built-in keyboard was completely unresponsive!

Luckily I came across [this Stack Overflow answer](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1352604/ubuntu-20-04-keyboard-not-working-on-lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-pro) which did the trick for me.

Once the installation was complete I needed to edit the GRUB config to fix this.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
```

Add these parameters to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` like so:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="atkbd.reset=1 i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset=1 i8042.nopnp=1 i8042.dumbkbd=1"
```

Once added, save and exit, then update your grub and reboot, like so:

```bash
sudo update-grub && reboot
```

I'm not sure if all of these paramters were required in my case, but I never bothered to try them one at a time or different combinations. If it works, it works.

The only thing I notice now is the light on the caps-lock key never turns on, but I can live with that ðŸ˜‰
