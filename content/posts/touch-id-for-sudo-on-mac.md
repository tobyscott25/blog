The other day I was watching one of [NetworkChuck's recent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOrlYzqXPa8) where he was running through a bunch of shell commands for Mac, and one stuck out to me in particular... The ability to configure Touch ID to authorise `sudo` commands! ðŸ¤¯

Edit the following file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/pam.d/sudo
```

Add this line `auth sufficient pam_tid.so` to the top of the file, below the comment. It should look something like:

```conf
# sudo: auth account password session

auth sufficient pam_tid.so

auth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so
auth       required       pam_opendirectory.so
account    required       pam_permit.so
password   required       pam_deny.so
session    required       pam_permit.so
```

Now close that Terminal, open a fresh one, run a `sudo` command and you'll be prompted to use your Touch ID! ðŸŽ‰

I considered that this could cause issues if running a `sudo` command while SSH'd into another server, but I tested it and was pleased to find it didn't interfere!

It's very simple, and now I really notice having to type my password for sudo commands on my desktop! ðŸ˜‚
